# insightful-sales-analytics

Implement a business dashboard with the following features:

- A header showing the company name (use "Acme Inc." as a placeholder for now)
- Cards showing the following key metrics:
  - Total Sales (use 100 as placeholder) 
  - Total Revenue (use $10,000 as placeholder)
  - Number of New Customers (use 50 as placeholder)
- A line chart showing Revenue over time (use fake data for the last 12 months)
- A bar chart showing Sales by Product Category (use 3 fake categories with fake sales data)

Use a professional-looking layout with a dark color scheme. Make the cards and charts interactive if possible.
